**Client type:** Temporary construction consortium (real estate development site)  

**Scenario:**
- The consortium operated without ERP or accounting software.  
- Invoices were managed manually by an external consultant via Excel.  
- Data was fragmented across **four unlinked workbooks**.  
- The internal **secretary**, with only basic Excel skills, prepared monthly and shareholder cost reports.  

**Goal:**  
To consolidate all datasets into a single, **clean and automated Excel model** for continuous reporting and cost monitoring.
