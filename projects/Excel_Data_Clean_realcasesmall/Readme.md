## <img src="./assets/section_icon_color.svg" alt="Project Icon" width="20"/> Overview
A real-case Excel workflow focused on **cleaning, merging, and automating supplier cost reports** for a construction consortium.  
Multiple unstructured Excel files were consolidated into a single **Fact Table**, powering dynamic pivot dashboards and printable financial summaries.

### Step 1 â€“ Raw Data Consolidation
Raw data came from four independent Excel files (Invoices, Suppliers, Extra Costs, and Purchases) with no shared keys.  
They were standardized and renamed for merge.

| Image | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| ![01](./assets/01_raw_file_overview.png) | Folder overview with original Excel files. |
| ![02](./assets/02_raw_invoices_2024_2025.png) | Raw invoice data (2024â€“2025) with inconsistent formats. |
| ![03](./assets/03_raw_purchases_summary.png) | Unstructured supplier purchase summary. |
| ![04](./assets/04_raw_extra_costs.png) | Extra cost sheet (utilities, salaries, taxes). |
| ![05](./assets/05_raw_secondary_2025.png) | Additional 2025 dataset for validation. |

---

### Step 2 â€“ Data Cleaning & Merge
All cleaned sources were merged into a single **Fact Table** containing normalized fields:  
Year, Category, Subcategory, and Incidence %.

| Image | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| ![06](./assets/06_first_merge_preview.png) | First merge test between cost and invoice datasets. |
| ![07](./assets/07_fact_table_base.png) | Base Fact Table with standardized fields. |
| ![08](./assets/08_fact_table_refined.png) | Refined version with cost classification and validation logic. |

---

### Step 3 â€“ Reporting & Analysis
Dynamic pivot tables were implemented to summarize and analyze supplier and cost data.

| Image | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| ![09](./assets/09_cost_center_report.png) | Cost center aggregation dashboard. |
| ![10](./assets/10_supplier_detail_pivot.png) | Supplier detail breakdown by document. |
| ![11](./assets/11_filtered_summary_report.png) | Example of final printable summary report. |

## <img src="./assets/section_icon_color.svg" alt="Project Icon" width="20"/> Privacy Note
This project was built using **real operational data** from a construction consortium.  
All supplier names and identifiable information were **anonymized** in the public version  
to ensure full compliance with privacy and data protection requirements.

## <img src="./assets/section_icon_color.svg" alt="Project Icon" width="20"/> Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel 365** â€“ main environment  
- **Power Query** â€“ merge and normalization  
- **Pivot Tables** â€“ automated dashboards  
- **Conditional Formatting** â€“ highlighting and validation  
- **Manual normalization** â€“ supplier and category cleanup
- **Python (OpenPyXL)** â€“ used to anonymize supplier names in the final Excel file
